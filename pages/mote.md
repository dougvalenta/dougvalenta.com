# Mote

Mote is a real-time storytelling platform inspired by MUDs, IF,
and online RP I'm creating with my co-creator and husband, John Zajac.

Visit our site to [learn more about Mote and sign up for the waiting list][1].

In June 2020, I gave [a talk called "Building narrative chat"][2] about the
core technology behind Mote.

You can [follow Mote on Twitter][3].
