I'm a computer programmer and creator interested in games, narrative, language, and
the web. You can <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@dougv" rel="me">find me on Mastodon</a>.

Lately, I'm creating [Mote][2] with my co-creator and husband John Zajac.
I gave [a talk about narrative chat][3], the core technology behind Mote,
at [NarraScope 2020][4].
